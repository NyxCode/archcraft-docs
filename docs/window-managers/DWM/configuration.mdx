### Introduction

DWM is configured by modifying its source code. When installed through the `archcraft-dwm` package, the source is copied to `/opt/dwm-source`.  
In that directory, you can find the `config.def.h` C header file.  
If you are not comfortable configuring it this way, DWM might not be the right choice for you.

### Compiling

After making changes, DWM needs to be recompiled. For this, run `sudo make clean` and `sudo make install`. Finally, restart DWM with **MOD+SHIFT+R**.  

### Default Applications

To configure the default applications (Terminal Emulator, Browser, etc.), you have two choices.  
1. **Set them in `config.def.h` directly**  
To set a default applications in `config.def.h` directly, find its definition and set its executable path and pass optional arguments.  
For example, this line replaces Firefox with Google Chrome. The arguments `--enable-features=WebUIDarkMode` and `--force-dark-mode` force Chrome to always use a dark theme:
```c
static const char *webcmd[]             = { "/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable", "--enable-features=WebUIDarkMode", "--force-dark-mode", NULL  };
```
2. **Delegate to an external script**  
By default, most keybindings delegate to scripts in `/usr/share/archcraft/dwm/`.  
Making changes to these scripts does not require recompilation or a restart.
